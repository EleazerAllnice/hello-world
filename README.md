# hello-world
first project using GitHub ...... a journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step
this is nust some small information about me. 

when i started learning java, the first thing i learnt was how to print to the console
and this is how it is done.


// this program prints something to the console
public class Print{


public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.println("this is what im talking about")

}
}
